Contributing to Brother Electronics Website
First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute. The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Brother Electronics Website and its packages, which are hosted in the (https://github.com/lakshyatm/MINOR_PROJECT) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

CODE OF CONDUCT
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the CODE OF CONDUCT. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to lakshyatm01@gmail.com.

LET'S GET STARTED
To get an overview of the project, read the README. Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub
Set up Git
GitHub flow
Collaborating with pull requests


How Can I Contribute?
Issues
Create a new issue
If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

Solve an issue
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information.

Make changes in the UI
Click Make a contribution at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the .md file where you can make your changes and create a pull request for a review.

Make changes in the CODE
The best way to contribute is to "clone" your fork of contact-app to your development area. That sounds like some jargon, but "forking" on GitHub means "making a copy of that repo to your account" and "cloning" means "copying that code to your environment so you can work on it".

Set up Git (Windows, Mac & Linux)
Go to the contact-app repo
Fork it
Clone your forked contact-app repo: git@github.com:/contact-app.git.
Checkout the "develop" branch. At this point you are ready to start making changes.
Fix existing bugs on the Issue tracker after taking a look to see nobody else is working on them.
Commit the files
Push your develop branch to your fork
Send a pull request
We will now be alerted about the change and at least one of the team will respond. If your change fails to meet the guidelines it will be bounced, or feedback will be provided to help you improve it. Once we handle your pull request, we will merge it into develop and your patch will be part of the next release.

Keeping your fork up-to-date
Unlike systems like Subversion, Git can have multiple remotes. A remote is the name for a URL of a Git repository. By default your fork will have a remote named "origin" which points to your fork, but you can add another remote named "contact app" which points to git://github.com/bcit-ci/contact-app.git. This is a read-only remote but you can pull from this develop branch to update your own.

If you are using command-line you can do the following:

git remote add contact-app git://github.com/bcit-ci/contact-app.git
git pull contact-app develop
git push origin develop
Now your fork is up to date. This should be done regularly, or before you send a pull request at least.
